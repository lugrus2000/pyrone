        Virtual environment
        -------------------
        
        It's strongly recommended to use virtual python environment with locally 
        installed ``pyramid`` and other required packages. Further in this README.txt
        it's assumed that ``python`` binary is located in your virtual environment.
        The same thing for ``easy_install`` executable.
        
        To make your life easy use script ``bin/activate`` from virtual environment to 
        update local environment variables (``PATH`` etc), in that case you can run executables
        like ``python`` and ``easy_install`` without using full paths to them.
