Description: Required packages

        The following packages are required, install using ``easy_install``:
        
            pyramid SQLAlchemy markdown pytz hurry.filesize tweepy zope.sqlalchemy pyramid_beaker decorator
            
        The following packages are required for development:
        
            nose coverage Babel

        Development
        ===========
        
        Virtual environment
        -------------------
        
        It's strongly recommended to use virtual python environment with locally 
        installed ``pyramid`` and other required packages. Further in this README.txt
        it's assumed that ``python`` binary is located in your virtual environment.
        The same thing for ``easy_install`` executable.
        
        To make your life easy use script ``bin/activate`` from virtual environment to 
        update local environment variables (``PATH`` etc), in that case you can run executables
        like ``python`` and ``easy_install`` without using full paths to them.
        
        
        Tests and coverage
        ------------------
        
        Running the tests:
        
            python setup.py test -q
            
        Collecting coverage information:
        
            nosetests --cover-package=pyrone --cover-erase --with-coverage
           
        Localization and internationalization
        -------------------------------------
        
        Pyrone uses ``Babel`` package to maintain ``gettext``-translation file. Here are the most used
        commands.
        
        Collect messages from source files:
        
            python setup.py extract_messages
        
        Start new language ("es", Spanish in this case):
        
            python setup.py init_catalog -l es
        
        Update messages (using .pot-file created by ``extract_messages`` command):
        
            python setup.py update_catalog
        
        Or collect and update in one step:
        
            python setup.py extract_messages update_catalog
        
        Compile translation files:
        
            python setup.py compile_catalog
        
        Running application
        -------------------
        
        To start development server use the following command:
        
            paster serve --reload development.ini
