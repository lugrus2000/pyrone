Required packages
=================

The following packages are required, install using ``easy_install``:

    pyramid SQLAlchemy markdown pytz hurry.filesize tweepy zope.sqlalchemy pyramid_beaker decorator TurboMail
    
The following packages are required for development:

    nose coverage Babel
    
You'll also need packages:

    PIL lxml
    
Development
===========

Virtual environment
-------------------

It's strongly recommended to use virtual python environment with locally 
installed ``pyramid`` and other required packages. Further in this README.txt
it's assumed that ``python`` binary is located in your virtual environment.
The same thing for ``easy_install`` and ``pip`` executables.

To make your life easier use script ``bin/activate`` from virtual environment to 
update local environment variables (``PATH`` etc), in that case you will be able
to execute binaries like ``python`` and ``easy_install`` without specifying full path.

Preparing virtual environment
---------------------------

It's assumed here and later that you're using Debian/Ubuntu linux distribution. So open
terminal now and proceed.

First you need to install ``python`` (version 2.6 is recommended), you'll also
need python package ``virtualenv``, you can install them using command

    sudo apt-get install python2.6 python-virtualenv
    
Now you have to choose directory where you'll install virtual environment for ``pyramid``,
it should be somewhere in your home directory, don't install it in the system directories.

Go to selected directory (create it if required) and issue the following command:

    virtualenv --no-site-packages ./env

You'll get directory ``env`` with new virtual environment, now you should *activate* it, after 
activation all required commands will be executed from your virtual environment, not from the
system. Required commands are: ``python``, ``pip`` etc. So activate:

    source ./env/bin/activate

Install packages required for the application:

    pip install pyramid SQLAlchemy markdown pytz hurry.filesize tweepy zope.sqlalchemy pyramid_beaker decorator nose coverage Babel
    
Wait until it finish downloading and installing the packages.

Also you'll need to install additional binary packages:

    pip install lxml PIL

The require install ``gcc`` and other stuff like ``libxml2-dev``.

Tests and coverage
------------------

Running the tests:

    python setup.py test -q
    
Collecting coverage information:

    nosetests --cover-package=pyrone --cover-erase --with-coverage
   
Localization and internationalization
-------------------------------------

Pyrone uses ``Babel`` package to maintain ``gettext``-translation file. Here are the most used
commands.

Collect messages from source files:

    python setup.py extract_messages

Start new language ("es", Spanish in this case):

    python setup.py init_catalog -l es

Update messages (using .pot-file created by ``extract_messages`` command):

    python setup.py update_catalog

Or collect and update in one step:

    python setup.py extract_messages update_catalog

Compile translation files:

    python setup.py compile_catalog

Running application
-------------------

To start development server use the following command:

    paster serve --reload development.ini
    
Release and packaging
=====================

Prepare nginx runtime environment
---------------------------------

You need ``supervisord`` package:

    pip install supervisor

Prepare application package
---------------------------
