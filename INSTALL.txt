Pyrone installation
===================

Prepare nginx site
------------------

You need to create nginx config file for your site.

Prepare runtime directory
-------------------------

You need to prepare directory where your application will be installed, let's assume
it's ``/home/user/pyrone-blog`` (we'll later reference it as ``$BLOG``).

Inside ``$BLOG`` you have to create virtual environment, application directory, configuration
files.

Prepare virtual environment
---------------------------

First install package ``python-virtualenv`` using ``apt-get`` (or whatever you're using for installing
packages):

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv


Then initialize new virtual environment (remember ``$BLOG`` is pointing to application root
directory):

    virtualenv --no-site-packages $BLOG/env

Now you have to *activate* just installed environment:

    source $BLOG/env/bin/activate

Before installing Pyrone you have to install binary packages from your distribution that required to
compile binary python packages: ``libxslt1-dev gcc python2.6-dev``. Instead of ``python2.6-dev`` you should
install ``python2.7-dev`` if you're using Python version 2.7.

Download Pyrone distribution package (e.g. ``pyrone-1.0.tar.gz``) and install it, all python packages
Pyrone depends upon will be downloaded and installed automatically:

    pip install pyrone-0.1.tar.gz

Now create mysql database (if you've chosen mysql and not sqlite database engine driver), type in 
mysql root console:

    CREATE DATABASE pyrone_blog;
    CREATE USER 'pyrone_blog_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pbpass';
    GRANT ALL ON pyrone_blog.* TO 'pyrone_blog_user'@'localhost';

Also you have to configure encoding issues for the mysql server.

Now prepare the application configuration files:

   cd $BLOG
   cp ./env/share/pyrone/sample-config/production.ini .

Open file ``production.ini`` in your favourite text editor and change default database connection
parameters to yours.

Now check that you've configured application properly, for that execute the following command inside
the directory ``$BLOG``:

    ./env/bin/paster serve production.ini

If configuration steps were performed correctly you should see somethign like this:

    Starting server in PID 5712.
    serving on 0.0.0.0:6543 view at http://127.0.0.1:6543
